JavaScript Boolean is a datatype that returns either true or false In JavaScript, a boolean is used as a function to get the value of a variable, object, conditions, expressions, etc in terms of true or false

JavaScript Boolean Constructor: A constructor gets called when an object is created using the new keyword

JavaScript Boolean Methods: Methods are actions that can be performed on objects.

Instance Method: If the method is called on an instance of a boolean then it is called an instance method

//dataView
JavaScript dataView is used to control how we can access data, regardless of executing endianness. And provides an interface to read and write more than one number types into an ArrayBuffer.

DatView():	Create dataView objects or returns a new DataView object that will represent the specified data buffer
constructor:	Return the dataView constructor method for the object.
buffer:	An ArrayBuffer that is already existing to store the new DataView object.
byteLength	Start a new view of the buffer. By default, the new view starts from the first byte.
byteOffset:	It represents number of elements in the byte array
