The Javascript Math object is used to perform mathematical operations on numbers

The Math.round() method returns the value of a number rounded

The Math.ceil() method returns the value of a number rounded up
to its nearest integer. If a number is already an integer, the method
will return the same number:

The Math.floor() method returns the value of a number rounded
down to its nearest integer. Like the Math.ceil() method, if a
number is already an integer, the method will return the same
number

The Math.random() method returns a random number between 0
(inclusive), and 1 (exclusive)

he Math.max() method returns the largest value of a set of numbers. The method expects these numbers to be passed as individual

Calling Math.max() with no arguments will return -Infinity

The Math.min() method returns the smallest value of a set of
